Herkan the Cunning

God of forethought and adaptability. Worshippers have access to a range of temporary enhancements,
but must prepare them well in advance of their need. Additionally, maintaining an enhancement
requires considerable concentration, so other attributes will suffer until the worshipper relaxes.

Novice followers may only maintain one preparation at a time. Increasing piety grants access to a
larger set of available preparations, and allows maintaining more than one at a time. Preparing
higher-tier abilities, or maintaining multiple at once, carries an extra cost, measured in slaying
and spellpower penalties; training in Invocations reduces these extra costs.

Making preparations, or relaxing them, only takes a single turn. However, there is a 200-aut
"warmup" or "cooldown" period, after activating or deactivating a preparation, in which you suffer
the penalties but gain none of the benefits. This mechanic exists so you can't prepare rF+ (or relax
rC-) as soon as an OOF comes into view, but you also don't have to spend 20 turns praying or
whatever, which would be annoying if popcorn monsters interrupted you. TODO: warmup encourages
pressing 5, which is crummy, so it'd be nice to find a friendlier mechanic.

Possible concern: if what Invocations does is defray the Horr cost of holding more abilities, I've
effectively turned Invocations into just a generic +damage skill. It would be nice to find a use
for Invocations that is more exciting.

Candidate preparations/penalties table:

Advantage       Penalty   Piety required    Notes
+Slay           -AC/EV    *                 Here "Slay" also applies to spellpower, as with Horr/Aug
+EV/AC          -Slay     *                 And the bonus for these three should be larger than the
                                            penalty, eg +6 EV/AC but only -3Slay or whatever
                                            (also, large enough to compensate for the extra -Horr)

Regen+          Hunger+   **                Hunger applies even when at full health: it's not "free"
Hunger-         None      **                The generic costs should be enough for such a mild bonus

rF+             rC-       ***               Possibly should be rF++/rC-, or rF+/rC--?
rC+             rF-       ***
Diversions      Noisy?    ***               When damaged, you have a chance to trigger one of a set
                                            of defensive effects: fog, butterflies, illusions,
                                            something like that.

Stlth+++        MR-       ****              Probably useless for most players, and needs to be a
                                            large boost to be meaningful to stabbers
MR+             Inacc,    ****              Flavour like you lose focus on the material world while
                *Confuse                    concentrating on magical defenses

Escape route    Stasis*   *****             Places an anchor at the player's location; aT begins
                                            a teleport to that spot from anywhere on the same floor;
                                            while waiting for the teleport to kick in, the player
                                            cannot take any actions (they are effectively paralysed)
                                            The stasis only prevents tloc/haste, not nasty effects
                                            like slow/paralyse (or maybe it does?)
Dervish         Monster   *****             Lets you perform some large number of turns (5? 10?)
                Dervish!                    in a row, taking up no time. Causes Exh after
                                            activating, plus gives monsters a chance to take
                                            several turns in a row against you. Probably fewer, like
                                            if you get 100 auts, monsters probably only get 50 auts,
                                            otherwise it would frequently just kill you. The
                                            generic penalties for maintaining a 5* ability help to
                                            offset the difference between the bonus and the penalty.
