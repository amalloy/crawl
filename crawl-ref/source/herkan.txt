Herkan the Cunning

God of forethought and adaptability. Worshippers have access to a range of temporary enhancements,
but must prepare them well in advance of their need. Additionally, maintaining an enhancement
requires considerable concentration, so other skills will suffer until the worshipper relaxes.

Novice followers may only maintain one preparation at a time. Increasing piety grants access to a
larger set of available preparations, and greater Invocations skill increases the effectiveness of
each preparation, as well as allowing a follower to maintain more preparations at a time.

Making preparations, or relaxing them, only takes a single turn. However, there is a 100-aut
"warmup" or "cooldown" period, after activating or deactivating a preparation, in which you suffer
the penalties but gain none of the benefits. This mechanic exists so you can't prepare rF+ (or relax
rC-) as soon as an OOF comes into view, but you also don't have to spend 10 turns praying or
whatever, which would be annoying if popcorn monsters interrupted you. TODO: warmup encourages
pressing 5, which is crummy, so it'd be nice to find a friendlier mechanic.

Candidate preparations/penalties table:

Advantage       Penalty   Piety required    Notes
+Slay           -AC/EV    *                 Here "Slay" also applies to spellpower, as with Horr/Aug
+EV/AC          -Slay     *                 And the bonus for these three should be larger than the
                                            penalty, eg +6 EV/AC but only -3Slay or whatever

Regen+          Hunger+   **                Hunger applies even when at full health: it's not "free"
Hunger-         None      **                It's okay for this to be free; just taking up two stars'
                                            worth of preparation slots discourages using something
                                            so weak

rF+             rC-       ***               Starts as rF+/rC--, scales to rF++/rC- with Invo
rC+             rF-       ***
Diversions      Noisy?    ***               When damaged, you have a chance to trigger one of a set
                                            of defensive effects: fog, butterflies, illusions,
                                            something like that.

Stlth+          MR-       ****
MR+             Inacc,    ****              Flavour like you lose focus on the material world while
                *Confuse                    concentrating on magical defenses

Escape route    Stasis*   *****             Places an anchor at the player's location; aT begins
                                            a teleport to that spot from anywhere on the same floor;
                                            while waiting for the teleport to kick in, the player
                                            is vulnerable somehow (slow? confuse? paralyse?).
                                            Increased Invocations shortens the time spent waiting.
                                            *The stasis only prevents tloc/haste, not nasty effects
                                            like slow/paralyse (or maybe it does?).

Dervish         Monster   *****             Lets you perform some large number of turns (5? 10?)
                Dervish!                    in a row, taking up no time. Causes Exh after
                                            activating, plus gives monsters a chance to take
                                            several turns in a row against you.
                                            Increased Invocations doesn't give you more turns, but
                                            does give monsters fewer(?)
